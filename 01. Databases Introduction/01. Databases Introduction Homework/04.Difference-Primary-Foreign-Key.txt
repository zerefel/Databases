What is a primary key?

The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. 
It can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be unique (such as an EGN (not a good idea though) in a table with no more than one record per person) 
or it can be generated by the DBMS (such as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, in Microsoft SQL Server). 
Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in combination.

In this scenario: http://i.imgur.com/lSiEcdt.png you can think of the indexes prior to the Name column as primary keys.


What is a foreign key?
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. 
It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them. 
In this scenario: http://i.imgur.com/Yhu0H3H.png the AddressId column holds foreign keys. Those foreign keys reference the PRIMARY keys of the Address Table.
This means that Pesho, who has an AddressId of 1 is from Sofia, because the primary key in the Address table for Sofia is 1.

What are the differences between a primary and a foreign key?

- Primary keys are used to identify records in a table, whereas foreign keys are used to access primary keys of other tables.

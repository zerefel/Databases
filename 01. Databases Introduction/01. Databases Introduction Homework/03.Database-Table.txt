In a relational database, a table (sometimes called a file) organizes the information about a single entity into rows and columns. 
For example, a database for a business would typically contain a table for customer information, which would store customers' account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and so on as a series of columns. 
Each single piece of data (such as the account number) is a field in the table.
A column consists of all the entries in a single field, such as the telephone numbers of all the customers. 
Fields, in turn, are organized as records, which are complete sets of information (such as the set of information about a particular customer), each of which comprises a row.

Here's an example representing that basic concept: http://i.imgur.com/lSiEcdt.png

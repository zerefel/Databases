What are SQL transactions?

	A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. 
	Transactions are units or sequences of work accomplished in a logical order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or automatically by some sort of a database program.
	A transaction is the propagation of one or more changes to the database.
	For example, if you are creating a record or updating a record or deleting a record from the table, then you are performing transaction on the table. 
	It is important to control transactions to ensure data integrity and to handle database errors.
	Practically, you will club many SQL queries into a group and you will execute all of them together as a part of a transaction.


What is an ACID SQL Transaction?

	In computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. 
	In the context of databases, a single logical operation on the data is called a transaction. 
	For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.
	
	
Transaction log

	Every SQL Server database has a transaction log that records all transactions and the database modifications made by each transaction. 
	The transaction log must be truncated on a regular basis to keep it from filling up. 
	However, some factors can delay log truncation, so monitoring log size is important. Some operations can be minimally logged to reduce their impact on transaction log size.
	he transaction log is the most important component of a SQL Server database when it comes to the disaster recovery – however, it must be uncorrupted. 
	After each database modification – transaction occurrence, a log record is written to the transaction log. 
	All the changes are written sequentially.

Hey there, SoftUni fellow,
I didn't do that second homework problem because I am currently
working with MongoDB on a Forum project for my website.
I've included the backup, so you can have a look at it.

Also, I'll include a bash script for automatic backup, so if you need it 
some day, you can simply use linux's task scheduler (cron) to run it whenever you need!

Cheers
